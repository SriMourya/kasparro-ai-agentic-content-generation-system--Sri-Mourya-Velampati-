    {
      "question": "Is the GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum suitable for skin types other than oily or combination?",
      "answer": "While formulated specifically for Oily and Combination skin, normal skin types can also benefit. We advise individuals with dry or highly sensitive skin to perform a patch test first, and layer the serum under a substantial moisturizer if needed, due to the active nature of the 10% Vitamin C.",

    {
      "question": "How should I store the serum to ensure the Vitamin C remains potent and effective?",
