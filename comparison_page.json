    "comparison_points": [
      "Vitamin C Potency: Product A boasts a 10% concentration of Vitamin C, offering double the strength of Product B's 5%, suggesting potentially faster and more pronounced results in brightening and fading dark spots.",
      "Supporting Ingredients: Product A incorporates Hyaluronic Acid, providing enhanced hydration and plumping benefits, which is generally considered more beneficial for advanced skin concerns compared to Product B's use of Aloe Vera.",
      "Specificity and Benefits: Product A clearly targets Oily and Combination skin types and explicitly lists benefits like 'Brightening' and 'Fades dark spots.' Product B lacks specific targeting information and explicit benefit claims in its description.",
      "Value Proposition: Despite offering a significantly higher concentration of the key active ingredient and a superior secondary ingredient (Hyaluronic Acid), Product A is nearly 40% less expensive than Product B (699 INR vs. 1200 INR), making it the far superior option for value."
    ],
    "verdict": "The GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum (Product A) is the decisive winner. It provides a highly concentrated 10% dose of Vitamin C combined with Hyaluronic Acid for comprehensive results. Given its targeted benefits, higher potency, and vastly lower price point, Product A delivers exceptional performance and value compared to the lower concentration and higher cost of the RadianceX Serum."
