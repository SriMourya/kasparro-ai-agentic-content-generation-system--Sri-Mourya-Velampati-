      "Vitamin C Concentration: Product A boasts a powerful 10% Vitamin C concentration, double the potency of Product B's 5%. This difference suggests Product A will deliver more significant brightening and anti-aging results.",
      "Value and Price: Product A is priced at 699 INR, offering excellent value. Product B is significantly more expensive at 1200 INR, despite offering half the active ingredient concentration.",
      "Transparency and Clarity: Product A is highly transparent, detailing specific benefits (Brightening, Fades dark spots), clear usage instructions (2-3 drops, morning), and potential side effects (Mild tingling). Product B lacks specified benefits, usage instructions, and disclosed side effects, making consumer decision-making difficult.",
      "Ingredient Profile: Product A includes Hyaluronic Acid, a powerhouse hydrator often paired with Vitamin C to mitigate dryness, alongside the primary active. Product B lists Aloe Vera as the additional key ingredient.",
      "Targeted Use: Product A clearly targets Oily and Combination skin types, providing specialized guidance. Product B does not specify a suitable skin type."

It provides a superior 10% active concentration at a much lower price point, offering far better overall value. Furthermore, its comprehensive transparency regarding benefits, usage, and ingredients makes it a much more trustworthy and effective choice for consumers seeking powerful brightening results."
